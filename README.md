# CoronaHack -Chest X-Ray-Dataset

Classify the X Ray image which is having Corona

# Context

Corona - COVID19 virus affects the respiratory system of healthy individual & Chest X -Ray is one of the important imaging methods to identify the corona virus.

With the Chest X - Ray dataset, Develop a Machine Learning Model to classify the X Rays of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients & this model powers the AI application to test the Corona Virus in Faster Phase.

# Content

Collection Chest X Ray of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients infected patients along with few other categories such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) ,Streptococcus & ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)

**Images name and labels are available in ChestXrayCorona_Metadata.csv**
